Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed\\nnor pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical\\narchitectures achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object\\nclassification (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with\\nerror rates of 2.53%, 19.51%, 0.35%, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple\\nback-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is\\nsurprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs. Test error\\nrates on MNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after 1, 3 and 17 epochs,\\nrespectively.',\n",
